Subject: Critical - Resolving "Out of Memory" Crashes on Render
1. Executive Summary
Problem: The chatbot backend service, deployed on a Render instance with 512MB RAM, is crashing frequently due to "Out of Memory" errors under minimal load.

Root Cause Analysis: The evidence strongly suggests that a large Machine Learning model (e.g., for language processing) is being loaded into memory on every single API request. This is a highly inefficient pattern that cannot scale. When a few users send messages concurrently, the server attempts to load the large model multiple times, immediately exhausting the available memory.

Required Action: The backend code must be refactored to load the ML model only once when the application server starts. The loaded model should then be stored in a global variable or a singleton instance and reused for all subsequent API requests.

2. Detailed Analysis
The Flutter client application functions correctly. For each message a user sends, it makes a new, stateless POST request to the backend. This is standard client behavior.

The issue lies in how the backend handles these requests. The memory crash indicates that the service is not reusing resources efficiently. Loading a large object, such as a tokenizer and a language model, is a time-consuming and memory-intensive operation. Performing this operation inside the request-response cycle is unsustainable.

Current (Problematic) Flow:

Flutter app sends POST /chat.

Render server receives the request.

Backend code loads the entire ML model from disk into RAM.

The model processes the user's query.

A response is sent.

The memory used by the model is eventually garbage collected, but if another request arrives before this happens, memory usage spikes.

Required (Optimized) Flow:

Render server starts the application process.

Backend code loads the ML model into a global variable ONE TIME.

The server is now "ready" and listening for requests.

Flutter app sends POST /chat.

Render server receives the request.

Backend code uses the pre-loaded model from memory to process the query.

A response is sent. This process is extremely fast and uses minimal additional memory per request.

3. API Contract (For Confirmation)
The backend must continue to adhere to the following API contract. The Flutter client is already coded to this specification.

Endpoint: POST {your_backend_url}

Content-Type: application/json

Request Body Schema:

{
  "session_id": "string",
  "query": "string"
}

Successful Response (200 OK) Body Schema:

{
  "response": "string"
}

(Note: The Flutter client currently expects the raw string response, but wrapping it in a JSON object as specified here is better practice for future expansion.)

4. Actionable Recommendations & Code Examples
The following examples use Python with the Flask framework, but the principle applies to any language or framework (FastAPI, Node.js, etc.).

Current (Problematic) Pattern - DO NOT USE
#
# This is an example of the WRONG way to do it.
#
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from my_model_library import load_big_model # Assume this loads your model

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def handle_chat():
    # PROBLEM: The model is loaded on every single request.
    # This will crash the server.
    model = load_big_model()
    
    user_query = request.get_json()['query']
    bot_response = model.predict(user_query)
    
    return jsonify({'response': bot_response})

Recommended (Optimized) Pattern - PLEASE IMPLEMENT
#
# This is the CORRECT, memory-efficient way to do it.
#
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from my_model_library import load_big_model # Assume this loads your model

app = Flask(__name__)

# --- THE FIX ---
# 1. Load the model ONCE when the application starts.
print("Initializing server: loading ML model...")
MODEL = load_big_model()
print("Model loaded successfully. Server is ready.")


@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def handle_chat():
    # 2. Reuse the pre-loaded model for every request.
    # This is extremely fast and memory-friendly.
    user_query = request.get_json()['query']
    bot_response = MODEL.predict(user_query)
    
    return jsonify({'response': bot_response})

5. Next Steps
Please review this report.

Locate the model loading logic in the current backend codebase.

Refactor the code to match the Recommended (Optimized) Pattern described above.

Deploy the updated service to Render.

Monitor the memory usage graph on the Render dashboard to confirm that the issue is resolved. The memory should now be stable after the initial startup load.
